# Business Formation and Insurance Status

This document provides a clear statement of my current business formation status and the steps I am actively completing to become fully compliant for paid consulting work.

---

## 1. Current Status

At this time:

- I do **not** currently have an active LLC or formal business entity.
- I do **not** yet have business insurance (General Liability or Professional Liability / E&O).

These items are in progress and are being set up as part of my transition into formal consulting and contracting work.

No billable work will begin until all business formation and insurance requirements are fully completed.

## 2. Steps in Progress

### 2.1 LLC Formation
I am in the process of forming a single-member LLC to ensure:
- proper legal structure  
- personal liability protection  
- clean invoicing and contracting  
- eligibility for insurance and business banking  

### 2.2 EIN Registration
An Employer Identification Number (EIN) will be obtained to support:
- tax reporting  
- invoicing  
- business bank account setup  

### 2.3 Business Insurance
I am preparing to obtain:
- General Liability coverage  
- Professional Liability / Errors & Omissions (E&O) coverage  

These policies are required before beginning any paid ML, software, or systems consulting.

### 2.4 Business Banking
A dedicated business bank account will be opened once the LLC formation and EIN issuance are completed.

### 2.5 Business Email (Planned Upgrade)
A dedicated, domain-backed business email (e.g., `@companyname.com`) will be created **once the LLC and business banking are finalized**.  
This ensures:
- proper branding  
- separation of personal and business communication  
- compliance with enterprise client expectations  
- secure communication channels  

Until then, professional communication occurs through a temporary address.

## 3. Expected Completion Window

Because these steps depend on state processing times and insurer availability, exact dates cannot be guaranteed.

Typical ranges are:

- **LLC formation:** 1–10 business days  
- **EIN:** immediate to 1–2 weeks  
- **Insurance underwriting:** same day to 72 hours after application  
- **Business bank account:** same day once LLC and EIN are finalized  

Progress updates will be provided as each milestone is completed.

## 4. Work Start Policy

To ensure full compliance and protection for both client and contractor:

**No billable or contractually binding work will begin until the following are complete:**

1. LLC formed  
2. EIN issued  
3. Business insurance active  
4. Business bank account established  
5. Business email (if required by client)  
6. Master Consulting Agreement (MCA) signed  
7. Statement of Work (SOW) approved  
8. Upfront payment or retainer (if applicable) processed  

This ensures proper legal, financial, and risk-management structures before engagement begins.
