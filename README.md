# Previous Work Showcase

The following public repositories demonstrate the quality, structure, and technical depth of my engineering work.  
These projects provide examples of my capabilities in ML systems design, research architecture, and pipeline engineering.

## Aurora-v2 Pipeline

End-to-end ML/quant research system featuring:

- pipeline orchestration  
- leakage-safe validation frameworks  
- multi-model ensemble systems  
- modular model zoo architecture  
- GPU-accelerated training workflows  

Repository:  
https://github.com/Aurora-Jennifer/Aurora-v2-Pipeline

## Additional Public Work

Additional repositories under my profile include:

- modeling utilities  
- HPC workflows  
- research tooling  
- experimental systems  

These serve as supplementary examples of engineering style, design philosophy, and project organization.

Template for formalizing project scope, deliverables, milestones, and timelines.  
A customized SOW is created for each engagement.

### 5. `MASTER_CONSULTING_AGREEMENT.md`
A formal agreement outlining payment terms, intellectual property rights, confidentiality obligations, warranties, and termination clauses.

### 6. `ADVANCED_OUTLINE_WIP.md`
A working outline used for complex or multi-stage engagements, including advanced ML pipelines, quant research modules, and HPC infrastructure design.

### 7. `CAPABILITIES_OVERVIEW.md`
Summarizes technical skill areas, engineering strengths, and core competencies across ML, quant, and HPC domains.

### 8. `IP_TERMS.md`
Defines intellectual property boundaries, licensing options, and ownership distinctions between pre-existing and client-specific deliverables.

### 9. `S&A_POLICY.md` (Security & Access Policy)

# How to Use These Documents

1. Review the materials in this repository to understand my consulting structure, capabilities, and policies.  
2. If the project appears to be a good fit, an introductory meeting can be scheduled to discuss scope and requirements.  
3. A customized Statement of Work (SOW) will be drafted based on the information provided.  
4. Work begins once the SOW and Master Consulting Agreement are formally approved.
