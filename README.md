## Business Formation Status (Updated)

As of now:

- **Fox ML Infrastructure LLC is officially formed and active.**  
- Primary ML/infra engineering product line: **Fox-v1-infra**.  
- **EIN issuance is pending** (filed with IRS, 1–4 day processing window).  
- A **business bank account will be opened** immediately once the EIN is issued.  
- **Business insurance (General Liability + E&O)** will be acquired after banking is established.  

No billable or contractually binding work will begin until all compliance requirements—banking, insurance, and agreement documents—are completed.
