# Consulting Policy

This document outlines the professional terms under which I provide machine learning, systems engineering, and quantitative research consulting services to organizations.

**These terms apply to all clients unless a written contract (SOW/MSA) explicitly states otherwise.**

I operate strictly as an **independent contractor**. All engagements are conducted on a contract basis with clearly defined deliverables, timelines, and boundaries.

---

## 1. Professional Scope

I provide consulting in the following areas:

- Machine learning pipeline design  
- Data processing, leakage-safe validation, and research methodology  
- Quantitative modeling and financial signal research  
- C++/Python hybrid systems  
- High-performance computing workflows  
- Architecture and systems design  
- Code review, audit, and optimization  
- Custom ML infrastructure development

Work is performed **remotely** and delivered according to a written Statement of Work (SOW).

I do **not** accept W-2 employment arrangements.

---

## 2. Client Neutrality

I work with any organization that respects:

- contractual boundaries  
- independent contractor status  
- agreed-upon scope and deliverables  
- professional conduct and communication  
- payment terms and invoicing processes  

Client industry, institutional type, or mission does not affect eligibility as long as the engagement remains lawful and professional.

---

## 3. Rates

### Base Rate  
**$300/hr**  
Minimum billing rate for all consulting work.

### Scope-Dependent Rates  
Projects involving:

- full ML pipeline architecture  
- C++ inference engines  
- HFT-oriented ML systems  
- urgent or time-sensitive work  
- high-throughput compute workflows  
- long-horizon research  

may be billed at a higher rate depending on depth and complexity.

### Retainers & On-Call Availability  

- 24/7 availability or priority response requires a retainer.  
- **On-call retainers start at $5,000–$15,000/month.**  
- Emergency/critical path work is billed at **2×–4×** the standard rate.

### Payment Terms  

- Invoices issued monthly or at milestones  
- Net 15 days  
- Late payments accrue 1.5% interest per month  
- Work may be paused if payment becomes overdue  

---

## 4. Work Model

### Remote-Only  
All work is conducted remotely. Meetings are held via video call or written channels.

### Defined Deliverables  
Each engagement requires an SOW specifying:

- deliverables  
- milestones  
- rate  
- timelines  
- communication expectations  

### No Open-Ended Scope Creep  
Any new requests, unplanned features, or scope changes are billed at the current hourly rate or added to a revised SOW.

## 4.1 Technical Autonomy & Implementation Independence

To maintain engineering quality, velocity, and reproducibility, the following autonomy principles apply:

### Client Defines Outcomes — Consultant Defines Methods  
Clients may specify:

- goals  
- performance requirements  
- integration constraints  
- datasets  
- deliverables  

However, clients **may not** dictate:

- my IDE/editor  
- my operating system  
- my libraries or tools  
- my workflow or coding patterns  
- internal architecture choices  
- work hours or scheduling  
- step-by-step implementation details  

I am contracted for expertise and outcomes, not supervised labor.

### No Micromanagement  
Attempts to micromanage implementation details, override technical decisions, or impose tool restrictions may:

- delay the project,  
- require revising the SOW, or  
- terminate the engagement if misalignment persists.

### Rationale  
This policy ensures:

- consistent engineering standards  
- proper use of established workflows  
- safe and leakage-free ML practices  
- IP protection  
- timely delivery and high-quality outcomes  

Clients hire me for my independent judgment as a specialist.

---

## 5. Communication Policy

### Professional Communication  
- Communication is asynchronous unless a meeting is scheduled.  
- All communication must remain professional and focused on deliverables.  
- I do not engage in invasive, personal, or non-work topics.  
- Harassment or unprofessional behavior terminates the contract immediately.

### For Organizations  
- Communication should be through designated project managers or authorized representatives.  
- Meeting cadence is defined in the SOW.  
- Urgent requests outside standard availability require a retainer.

---

## 6. Ownership & IP

Unless stated otherwise in the MSA/SOW:

- Client receives a **non-exclusive, non-transferable, internal-use license** to deliverables created during the engagement.  
- Consultant retains ownership of:
  - methodologies  
  - architectural frameworks  
  - reusable components  
  - generalized research workflows  
- All pre-existing IP (including Aurora-v2, pipelines, C++ engines) remains fully owned by Consultant.  
- Exclusive licensing or full ownership transfer must be explicitly negotiated.

This protects both parties and ensures sustainable development practices.

---

## 7. Confidentiality

All client materials, datasets, credentials, and proprietary information are confidential under standard NDAs or contract clauses.

No client data or proprietary material will be reused or shared unless explicitly permitted.

---

## 8. Termination

Either party may terminate:

- with **14 days’ written notice**, or  
- **immediately** in case of material breach  

Client is responsible for all billed hours up to the termination date.  
Retainers are non-refundable unless the SOW states otherwise.

---

## 9. Contact

**For Consulting Inquiries:**  
Email: jenn.lewis5789@gmail.com  
Subject: **Consulting Inquiry — [Organization Name]**

Initial inquiry should include:

- organization name and type  
- brief project description  
- preferred engagement timeline  
- relevant technical constraints  

Responses are typically provided within 2–3 business days.  
Initial intake is conducted asynchronously; no unscheduled phone calls.
