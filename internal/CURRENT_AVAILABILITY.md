# Current Availability and Readiness

This document outlines my present availability for consulting inquiries as well as the limitations in place while my business formation and insurance processes are being completed.

---

## 1. Current Availability

I am currently **available to review prospective client needs**, including:

- discussing high-level project goals  
- evaluating technical feasibility  
- reviewing data requirements  
- determining potential scope  
- assessing fit for a future engagement  
- answering general questions about my capabilities, workflows, and documentation  

During this stage, I can help clients understand whether their project aligns with my areas of expertise and whether a future engagement would be appropriate.

---

## 2. Limitations at This Stage

Although I am available for preliminary discussions, the following restrictions apply:

- **No formal agreements** can be signed yet  
- **No Statements of Work (SOWs)** will be drafted or delivered  
- **No billable work** will be performed  
- **No commitments** will be finalized  
- **No deliverables or development** will begin  

This is to ensure that all engagements occur under proper legal and insurance protection.

---

## 3. Business Formation Status

I am in the process of completing the following requirements:

- LLC formation  
- EIN registration  
- Business bank account setup  
- General Liability insurance  
- Professional Liability / Errors & Omissions (E&O) insurance  

These items must be finalized before any contractually binding or billable work begins.

Further detail on this process is provided in the separate **Business Formation and Insurance Status** document.

## 4. What I *Can* Do Right Now

While the business setup progresses, I am able to:

- Review client project descriptions  
- Provide high-level architectural thoughts (non-binding)  
- Identify potential approaches or strategies  
- Estimate work categories (not quotes)  
- Determine whether the project is a good match for my skill set  
- Begin prioritizing which incoming inquiries to accept once fully operational  

This phase is strictly exploratory and non-contractual.

---

## 5. What I *Cannot* Do Yet

Until all compliance steps are complete, I cannot:

- Enter a legally binding contract  
- Begin engineering work  
- Access proprietary data  
- Deliver analysis or code  
- Provide pricing quotes specific to a client  
- Commit to timelines or deliverables  
- Start a Statement of Work process  

These activities require full insurance and legal structure in place.

---

## 6. Expected Transition to Full Readiness

Once the following steps are complete:

1. LLC formed  
2. EIN received  
3. Business bank account active  
4. General Liability + E&O coverage issued  

I will be prepared to:

- conduct formal scoping meetings  
- prepare a Statement of Work  
- finalize Master Consulting Agreements  
- begin billable engineering or research work  

A separate notice will be posted when full readiness is reached.

---

## 7. Summary

At this stage, I am open to:

- evaluating potential projects  
- discussing scope and requirements  
- determining fit  
- preparing for future engagements  

However, **no formal or billable work** will begin until business formation and insurance coverage are fully established.

Clients are welcome to initiate early conversations, and I will provide updates as each compliance milestone is completed.
