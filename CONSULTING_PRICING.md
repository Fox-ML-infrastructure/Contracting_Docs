Definitions & Notes

Tier 0 — Baseline Advisory

For organizations needing:
	•	architectural explanation
	•	onboarding to Aurora
	•	technical review
	•	reading/understanding codebases
	•	planning support

No deliverables or engineering work are produced at this tier.

⸻

Tier 1 — Engineering Support

For organizations needing:
	•	improvements to existing Aurora systems
	•	debugging and diagnostics
	•	training pipeline stability work
	•	ensemble tuning
	•	minor C++ or Python modifications
	•	non-urgent development tasks

This tier covers work that enhances Aurora without creating new proprietary subsystems.

⸻

Tier 2 — Proprietary Development

For organizations requiring:
	•	internal versions of Aurora
	•	custom ML pipelines
	•	HPC-integrated workflow design
	•	proprietary inference systems
	•	secure internal deployments
	•	new ensembles, architectures, or tools
	•	integration with private data feeds

This is new engineering, not maintenance of the open-source repository.

⸻

Tier 3 — High-Urgency / Critical Response

Reserved for:
	•	rapid deadlines
	•	urgent system issues
	•	time-sensitive research needs
	•	production failures
	•	on-call availability

This tier reflects schedule disruption and priority escalation.

⸻

Retainers & Upfront Costs

Retainer Options

Monthly retainers are available for organizations that require:
	•	ongoing support
	•	periodic updates
	•	long-term research partnerships
	•	access to technical expertise on standby

Retainer engagements typically range from 15–40 hours per month depending on scope.

Upfront Payments

Standard policy:
	•	40% upfront for new clients or new projects
	•	Remaining balance billed at milestones or monthly

This ensures project commitment and protects long-running availability.

Every project includes a formal SOW outlining:
	•	scope
	•	deliverables
	•	timelines
	•	applicable rate tier(s)
	•	payment schedule

No work begins until both parties approve the SOW.

⸻

Summary

This pricing structure ensures:
	•	clarity
	•	fairness
	•	proper tiering based on complexity
	•	predictable budgeting for organizations
	•	protection for long-running research and engineering work
